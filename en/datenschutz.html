              <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>
              <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
              <p>You have the right to receive free information at any time about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for any further questions regarding data protection, you can contact us at any time at the address provided in the Legal Notice.

              <h3>Analysis Tools and Tools from Third Parties</h3>
              <p>When you visit our website, your surfing behavior may be statistically evaluated. This is primarily done using cookies and so-called analysis programs.

Detailed information on this can be found in the privacy policy below.</p>
              <p>You can object to this analysis. We will inform you about the objection options in this privacy policy.</p>

              <h2>2. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h2>

              <p>Please note that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
              <h3>Notice Regarding the Responsible Party</h3>
              <p>The party responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
              <p>YOUR TIMES REAL ESTATE<br>Ms. Judith Lenz<br>Hagenstr. 9<br>D-14193 Berlin<br>tel: +49 (0) 30 / 39716900<br>info@your-times.com</p>
              <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
              <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
              <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. An informal email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
              <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
              <p>If there has been a breach of data protection law, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority for matters of data protection law is the Data Protection Officer of the federal state in which our company is based. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>
              <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
              <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format.

              <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
              <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the browser's address line changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
              <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
              <h3>Information, Blocking, Deletion</h3>
              <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address provided in the Legal Notice.</p>
              <h3>Objection to Promotional Emails</h3>
              <p>The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby objected to.

              <h2>4. Data Collection on Our Website</h2>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>Our website uses cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p>
              <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.</p>
              <p>You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
              <p>Cookies that are necessary for the electronic communication process or for providing certain functions you desire (e.g., shopping cart function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. Insofar as other cookies (e.g., cookies to analyze your browsing behavior) are stored, they are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>
              <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
              <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Browser type and version</li>
                <li>Operating system used</li>
                <li>Referrer URL</li>
                <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>Time of the server request</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This data will not be merged with other data sources.</p>
              <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures.</p>
              <h3>Registration on This Website</h3>
              <p>You can register on our website to use additional features on the site. We use the data entered for this purpose only for the use of the respective offer or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject the registration.</p>
              <p>For important changes, such as the scope of the offer or for technically necessary changes, we use the email address provided during registration to inform you in this way.</p>
              <p>The processing of the data entered during registration is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
              <p>The data collected during registration will be stored by us as long as you are registered on our website and will be deleted thereafter. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
              <h3>Comment Function on This Website</h3>
              <p>For the comment function on this page, in addition to your comment, information on the time the comment was created, your email address, and, if you do not post anonymously, the username you have chosen will be stored.</p>
              <h4>Storage of IP Address</h4>
              <p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of users who write comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before activation, we need this data in order to be able to take action against the author in case of legal violations such as insults or propaganda.</p>
              <h4>Subscribing to Comments</h4>
              <p>As a user of the site, you can subscribe to comments after registering. You will receive a confirmation email to check whether you are the owner of the provided email address. You can unsubscribe from this function at any time via a link in the information emails. The data entered as part of subscribing to comments will be deleted in this case; if you have transmitted this data to us for other purposes and elsewhere (e.g., newsletter subscription), it will remain with us.</p>
              <h4>Storage Period of Comments</h4>
              <p>The comments and the associated data (e.g., IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the commented content has been completely deleted or the comments must be deleted for legal reasons (e.g., offensive comments).</p>
              <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
              <p>The storage of comments is based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email to us is sufficient. The legality of data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
              <h3>Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)</h3>
              <p>We collect, process, and use personal data only to the extent necessary for the establishment, content arrangement, or modification of the legal relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures. We collect, process, and use personal data about the use of our website (usage data) only to the extent necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill for it.</p>
              <p>The customer data collected will be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>

              <h2>5. ANALYSIS TOOLS AND ADVERTISING</h2>
              <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
              <p>This website uses features of the web analytics service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
              <p>Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies." These are text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
              <p>The storage of Google Analytics cookies is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
              <h4>IP Anonymization</h4>
              <p>We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. As a result, your IP address is truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before being transmitted to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data from Google.</p>
              <h4>Browser Plugin</h4>
              <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser software; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.</p>
              <h4>Objection to Data Collection</h4>
              <p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set that prevents the collection of your data during future visits to this website: Disable Google Analytics.</p>
              <p>Further information on how Google Analytics handles user data can be found in Google’s privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>.</p>
              <h4>Order Data Processing</h4>
              <p>We have concluded a data processing agreement with Google and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
              <h4>Demographic Features in Google Analytics</h4>
              <p>This website uses the "demographic features" function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be generated that contain statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising by Google and from visitor data from third-party providers. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can deactivate this feature at any time via the ad settings in your Google account or generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described under "Objection to Data Collection."</p>
              <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
              <p>This website uses Google AdSense, a service for integrating advertisements provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
              <p>Google AdSense uses so-called "cookies," text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Through these web beacons, information such as visitor traffic on these pages can be evaluated.</p>
              <p>The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of this website (including your IP address) and delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. This information may be passed on by Google to contractual partners of Google. However, Google will not merge your IP address with other data stored by you.</p>
              <p>The storage of AdSense cookies is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
              <p>You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data collected about you by Google in the manner and for the purpose described above.</p>
              <h3>Google Analytics Remarketing</h3>
              <p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing in conjunction with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
              <p>This function makes it possible to link the advertising target groups created with Google Analytics Remarketing with the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to you based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g., mobile phone) can also be displayed on another of your devices (e.g., tablet or PC).</p>
              <p>If you have given the corresponding consent, Google will link your web and app browsing history with your Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be delivered to every device on which you sign in with your Google account.</p>
              <p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users, which are temporarily linked with our Google Analytics data in order to define and create target groups for cross-device advertising.</p>
              <p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by deactivating personalized advertising in your Google account; to do so, follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
              <p>The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). For data collection processes that are not merged in your Google account (e.g., because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merging), the collection of the data is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymized analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.</p>

              <h3>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
              <p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
              <p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. If you click on an ad placed by Google, a cookie for conversion tracking is set. Cookies are small text files that the internet browser stores on the user's computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of users. If the user visits certain pages of this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.</p>
              <p>Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to this use by easily deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie via your internet browser under user settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
              <p>The storage of "conversion cookies" is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
              <p>More information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking can be found in Google’s privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
              <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. The functionality of this website may be limited if cookies are deactivated.</p>

              <h2>6. NEWSLETTER</h2>
              <h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
              <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address and agree to receive the newsletter.

              <h2>7. PLUGINS AND TOOLS</h2>
              <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
              <p>This site uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. When you access a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p>
              <p>For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. This allows Google to know that your IP address has accessed our website. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and appealing presentation of our online offerings. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
              <p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font from your computer will be used.</p>
              <p>Further information about Google Web Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
